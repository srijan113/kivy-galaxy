## Galaxy Game Python-Kivy


This is a offline Kivy Appilcation where we can move our 'ship' on the path.

```
Worked On:
    1. Random Path Generation
    2. Perspective view 2d-> 3d 
    3. Static Background
    4. Touch and keybord control
    5. Audio
```

For to work in your device:
```
    1. Python >= 3.6
    2. Kivy==2.0.0
```


How to run ?

Recomendation: Create a venv first then follow this steps

```
git clone <repo>

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd kivy-galaxy/

python main.py

```

Audio can or cannot run on some devices if it works or doesn't on any devices do tell about it.

I have included the anroid apk file inside: <br>
```kivy-galaxy/bin/myship-1.0-armeabi-v7a-debug.apk```
